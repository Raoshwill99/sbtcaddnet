# Smart Contract-Based sBTC Attack Detection and Defense Network

## Overview
This project implements an innovative security framework for monitoring and protecting sBTC transactions through automated threat detection and defense mechanisms. The system utilizes smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to provide real-time security monitoring and autonomous response capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Create an autonomous security monitoring system for sBTC transactions
- Implement pattern-based attack detection
- Develop automated defense mechanisms
- Reduce reliance on external monitoring systems
- Enhance overall sBTC network security

## 🏗 Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Transaction Monitor**
   - Tracks transaction history per user
   - Monitors transaction volumes and patterns
   - Implements threshold-based detection

2. **Threat Detection System**
   - Pattern recognition for suspicious activities
   - Real-time threat assessment
   - Event logging and notification system

3. **Defense Mechanism**
   - Automated response triggers
   - Configurable defense strategies
   - Administrative override capabilities

## 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Asset Focus**: sBTC

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js (for testing environment)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sbtc-security-monitor.git
cd sbtc-security-monitor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
clarinet install
```

3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## 💻 Usage

### Contract Initialization
```clarity
(contract-call? .sbtc-security-monitor initialize-monitoring)
```

### Register Transaction
```clarity
(contract-call? .sbtc-security-monitor register-transaction tx-sender amount)
```

### Check Transaction History
```clarity
(contract-call? .sbtc-security-monitor get-transaction-history user-address)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Current Implementation
- Transaction volume monitoring
- Threshold-based detection
- Suspicious activity logging
- Administrative controls

### Planned Enhancements
1. Advanced pattern recognition
2. Machine learning integration
3. Multi-signature defense mechanisms
4. Network-wide threat correlation
5. Automated mitigation strategies

## 🚀 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic monitoring system
- Transaction history tracking
- Simple threshold detection

### Phase 2: Enhanced Detection
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Historical analysis
- Risk scoring system

### Phase 3: Automated Defense
- Smart response mechanisms
- Network protection protocols
- Recovery procedures

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please read the contributing guidelines before submitting pull requests.

### Branch Structure
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/detection-enhancement`, `feature/defense-mechanism`, etc.

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes
3. Submit PR with detailed description
4. Await code review
5. Merge after approval

## ⚠️ Security Considerations
- Contract requires thorough security audit before mainnet deployment
- Administrative functions restricted to authorized addresses
- Regular monitoring of threshold parameters recommended
- Defense mechanisms should be carefully tested in testnet
